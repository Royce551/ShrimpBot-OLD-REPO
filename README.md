# TestBot 0.1
Welcome to this Github repository!
This is just a terribly made bot for shits and giggles that i'm working on, it isn't even doing the commands right.
I might re-do this in the future

You are free to copy this code, I literally do not give a crap.

ShrimpBot is no longer being worked on, which is great. It was a buggy mess and was very suspectable to attacks. If you're using Shrimpbot or it's code, please don't. Therefore, Shrimpbot (or Testbot) is now indefinitely frozen at version 0.1.2, at least, until I get more competant at coding and I can produce a bot that is worthy of being used.
