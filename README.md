# ShrimpBot 15.2
Welcome to this Github repository!
This is just a terribly made bot for shits and giggles that i'm working on, it isn't even doing the commands right.
I might re-do this in the future.
(Also, if you want to use this for yourself, you will need a python file called "ShrimpConfig" with a variable named "token" with your token in a string.)
